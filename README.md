# GroceryMarketCrawler
Web crawling on online grocery markets to obtain the price, promotion, discount, and other details of groceries. 
Online grocery markets included in this project are Aeon, Ben's Independent Grocer, Cold Storage, Hero Market, Jaya Grocer, Mydin, Redtick, and Tesco. 

## Requirements
1. Python 3.6.6
2. Selenium 3.14.0
3. Selenium web driver which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/)

## Others
There are two versions available, which are in Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts. The Python scripts were copied from the Jupyter Notebook because it is more convenient to run the codes in shell without unintended interruptions.
